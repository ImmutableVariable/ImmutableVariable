## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a hobbist developer who enjoys creating software, and implementing algorithms I find cool. I don't really have a specific focus, but a lot of cryptography and mathematically based stuff is quite interesting to me. I also have a series of challenges I post in this [repository](https://github.com/ImmutableVariable/Coding-Challenges) that I try to solve in different languages. Other than programming, I enjoy playing video games, and creating/flying FPV/Camera drones.
